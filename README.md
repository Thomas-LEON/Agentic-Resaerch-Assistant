# Simple Research Agent

This is a simplified version of a research agent that fetches papers from arXiv and generates a Markdown report.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the agent and generate a report, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py "your research topic"
```

For example:

```bash
python main.py "artificial intelligence in healthcare"
```

This will create a file named `report_artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare.md` in the root directory.
